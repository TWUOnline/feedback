# Designing Learning Experiences to Improve Student Writing

## Four Fallacies and some remedies

> ## “If I give students a writing assignment, they will know just what I want and will produce high-quality writing every time. If they don’t, there is nothing I can do about it.”

### Underlying assumptions:

* Students are inside your head.
* Students read instructions.
* Writing is like riding a bike—you learn how to do it and you’ve mastered that skill.
* Writing skills are static—you learn them, and you’re done.
* Professors can’t help students to develop their writing skills.

### Practical remedies:

* Assume nothing. Give clear written instructions.
* Go over the instructions in class.
* Teach writing as a lifelong process.
* Teach writing as formative process.
* Tell students you can help, and then help.

> ## “Students all took introductory writing classes, so they should be superb writers by now.”

### Underlying assumptions:

* Yes! The “riding a bike” assumption appears again.
* All students learn everything in all of their classes.
* Students can take one class and achieve excellence immediately.

### Practical remedies:

* Believe and teach writing as a lifelong process.
* Recognize that students have different abilities, engagement, and motivation.
* Repeat.

> ## “I wasn’t an English major so I can’t help students develop their writing. Besides, it’s not my job to teach writing; that’s why we have writing classes.”

### Underlying assumptions:

* Only English majors know how to write well.
* My own writing is incapable of further development.
* I can’t teach writing skills
* It’s not my responsibility´

### Practical remedies:

* Believe \(and teach\) that everyone is capable of learning to write better.
* Model for your students that you are still learning how to write better.
* Learn by teaching, teach by learning—anyone can teach writing skills!
* Good writing is relevant to all disciplines.

> ## “Providing writing feedback consists of circling grammatical errors and/or writing ‘this needs work’ in the margins.”

### Underlying assumptions:

* This approach is helpful.
* Students will read the comments.
* Students will apply this feedback to the next essay.
* Everything you identify on an essay has equal importance/weight.

### Practical remedies

* Provide constructive feedback.
* Emphasize that this feedback is part of the teaching/learning experience.
* Provide an opportunity or a requirement for students to apply the feedback in a revision or on a future assignment.
* Major on the majors, and indicate what the most important corrections are.

> ## “Providing writing feedback consists of circling grammatical errors and/or writing ‘this needs work’ in the margins.”

### Underlying assumptions:

* Students will know what a circled error is.
* Students will know how to correct a circled error.
* Students will know what “needs work.”

### Practical remedies

* Identify the problem clearly.
* Provide specific information about how to correct the problem.
* Specify what needs work, and why.
* Give specific feedback identifying what is good, as well as what needs work.

### Conclusion: The Big Picture

* Create realistic expectations: teach students that writing is a lifelong, formative process.
* Speak as a department: have a conversation as a department about your faculty’s expectations for written assignments, and communicate those expectations to your students
* Explain how life works: receiving different instructions in different contexts is part of real life.



### Conclusion: Creating Assignments

* Assume nothing: provide clear written instructions, and explain them verbally
* Provide a sample assignment: give students a model of how an assignment should look and what it should include.
* Teach “audience”: help students not to write an assignment, but to write for a reader. \(\#1 tip\)
* Teach context”: help students to understand the genre of writing you are requiring, and teach them the conventions of that genre \(e.g., essay, lab report, book report, personal response, creative piece\).



### Conclusion: Helping Students

* Tackle two or three issues: identify a few major writing issues that crop up in your classes over and over. Figure out how students can learn to conquer these issues, and explicitly teach these strategies.
* Foster students’ inquiry-based learning: Have students identify one or two of their own writing weaknesses, and help them to work on them during the semester.

### Make it manageable

* Avoid overwhelming students with so many things to correct that they feel it’s impossible to write well. Break tasks down into smaller parts.
* Make it personal: If possible, meet with students on-on-one to address at least one of their writing issues.

### Conclusion: Using Resources

* Use our student support resources: Recommend the Writing Centre and encourage students to use it. Send the WC copies of your assignment instructions. Ditto for the reference librarians.
* Use the Purdue Online Writing Lab: [https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/section/4](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/section/4/) has information on writing in the major disciplines.
* Ask your colleagues: network with those in the writing-intensive disciplines to develop your own writing and to help develop your students’ writing
