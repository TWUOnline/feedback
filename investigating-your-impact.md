## Action Research Project

Action research is an iterative research process grounded in practice with a view to develop theory based on that practice.

Your primary task for this short course is to engage in a small-scale \(or larger\) action research project investigating the impact of your feedback practices on student learning in your course. One of the defining characteristics of action research is that it often involves participants as co-investigators in the project.

This is not intended to be a major undertaking requiring ethics approval and leading to a formal publication, rather, we hope to provide you with a tool for your to investigate and know your impact in your classroom and to use that knowledge to improve your practice over time.

#### Process

As mentioned, action research is an iterative process, and it closely reflects the process of experiential inquiry that we have adopted in our liberal arts core curriculum.

##### Plan

In the planning phase, the section of this course called 'Analyzing your Practice', you identified one or more problems, or gaps, in your practice. Your action research project should seek to identify a practical solution to one of those gaps.

##### Act

You will need to implement your plan in your classroom along with a mechanism for gathering data. 

##### Observe
