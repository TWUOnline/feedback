### Effective Learning Environments

Biggs & Tang \(2011\) describe two \(stereotypical\) types of students that faculty may encounter in an academic environment, the academically-inclined 'Susan', and the academically-disinclined 'Robert'[^1].
>Let us look at two students attending a lecture. Susan is academically committed; she is bright, interested in her studies and wants to do well. She has clear academic or career plans and what she learns is important to her. When she learns, she goes about it in an ‘academic’ way. She comes to the lecture with sound, relevant background knowledge, possibly some questions she wants answering. In the lecture, she fi nds an answer to a preformed question; it forms the keystone for a particular arch of knowledge she is constructing. Or it may not be the answer she is looking for and she specu-lates, wondering why it isn’t. In either event, she refl ects on the personal signifi cance of what she is learning. Students like Susan virtually teach them-selves; they do not need much help from us. Academics like the Susans – indeed, they were once Susans themselves – so they tend to assume that she represents how most students learn, and they teach accordingly.

>Now take Robert. He is at university not out of a driving curiosity about a particular subject, or a burning ambition to excel in a particular profession, but to obtain a qualifi cation for a decent job. A few years ago, prior to the Bologna Process say (see below), he would never have considered going to university. He is less committed than Susan, possibly not as bright, academically speaking. He has little background of relevant knowledge. He comes to lectures with no or few questions. He wants only to put in suffi cient effort to pass and obtain that meal ticket. Robert hears the lecturer say the same words as Susan is hearing but he doesn’t see a keystone, just another brick to be recorded in his lecture notes. He believes that if he can record enough of these bricks and can remember them on cue, he’ll keep out of trouble come exam time.
