##Probing

Hattie (2011) argues that feedback should help students address a gap in their performance between what _is_ and what _should be_, by asking three questions:

1. Where am I going?
2. How am I going?
3. Where to next?

In the context of this course, you are going to become the source of your own formative feedback on your practice. There are certainly others who can help, and you are encouraged to reach out to them, but you are in the driver's seat.

###Finding a Gap

The first thing you will need to do in this process is to identify a gap in your practice in relation to the feedback that you provide for your students. Perhaps you have noticed that students don't read the feedback you provide on their assignments, or that too many students are not following appropriate conventions regarding attribution of others' ideas, or that your students' assignment submissions seem to be declining in quality year over year, or maybe students don't seem to be engaging with your assessments on a deep level.

You will have the best sense of where there are gaps in your process, but if you'd like assistance, please contact \[XXXXXX\] and we'd be happy to spend some time with you to help you think through your current practice.

Please note that it is not our intent to gather information about what you are doing in order to use that information against you in some way. We are here to support your growth as an educator.

Once you have identified a gap in your practice, you will need to take some time to dig into some literature. We suggest that you consult 2-3 peer-reviewed articles to begin to get a handle on the precise nature of the gap that you have identified.

Again, if you need assistance, since you may not be familiar with the body of research related to the scholarship of teaching and learning, please don't hesitate to reach out. Our librarians LOVE to help with research!

###Sharing your Gap

Here is where we will ask you to trust us and your community. And we ask the community to be trustworthy!

Take a few minutes to post some reflections in the forum on the gap that you have identified and a brief summary of what you have learned from your literature review. Please be concise. Provide a little bit of context, describe the problem that you are experiencing and then your mini lit review.
