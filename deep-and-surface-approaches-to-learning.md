### Deep and Surface Approaches

Learning environments are monumentally complex systems influenced by many different factors. Biggs, Kember and Leung \(2001\) created what they call the 3P Model for teaching and learning, reproduced below.

The 3P Model shows the different categories of influences on learning environments and how they interact to produce learning.

The presage influences are those factors which precede the learning environment, including both student factors and the teaching context. Student factors include such things as each student's individual prior knowledge, their cognitive ability and their preferred approaches to learning. Clearly, as the number of students in a particular learning environment increases, the number of influences increases exponentially. The teaching context includes the structure of the environment, how the objectives are designed and assessed, the social climate in the environment, characteristics of the teacher, and various institutional policies and procedures.

Student factors and the teaching context influence each other and they influence both the process and the products of the learning. This mutual influence suggests that students will adjust their preferred approach to learning when they encounter different teaching contexts or learning activities.

The second category of influences is the learning-focused activities in which students engage in order to meet the learning outcomes. Biggs, Kember and Leung refer to these activities as 'ongoing approaches to learning'. They argue that the process level is the 'heart of the teaching/learning system' \(p. 136\). In support of this view, they quote Shuell:

> If students are to learn desired outcomes in a reasonably effective manner, then the teacherâ€™s fundamental task is to get students to engage in learning activities that are likely to result in their achieving those outcomes. It is important to remember that what the student does is more important than what the teacher does. \(Shuell, 1986, p. 429\)

The question then becomes how to ensure that students are engaging in activities that are most likely to lead to them being able to attain the learning outcomes. As shown in the 3P model, the answer to that question depends on student preferences, the teaching context, and the nature of the learning outcomes.

Biggs, Kember, and Leung suggest that students typically take either a deep or a surface approach to any given learning activity.

Deep approaches are characterized by students using high-level cognitive skills for tasks which require them. Surface approaches are characterized by students using low-level cognitive skills for tasks which require high-level cognitive skills.

It may be that a given assessment task requires a relatively low-level cognitive skill, such as memorizing a mathematical formula, or a set of key dates in history. This is not necessarily a surface approach in that it is the appropriate strategy for attaining the outcome.[^1]

An example of a surface approach is the student who relies on memorizing facts in a module that is overloaded with content and assessed by a poorly-designed multiple guess exam. In this case the teaching context is influencing the student's approach regardless of whether the outcome is good or not.

The same student may meet the same outcome through the use of high-level cognitive skills if the amount of content in the module is reduced and assessed through the creation of a reflective portfolio.

Recall the discussion of the three different levels of thinking about teaching. Faculty who focus their efforts on student factors in the 3P model are following a 'blame the student' ethos, while faculty who focus on the teaching context are blaming faculty for students not attaining outcomes. 

Conversely, a learning-centred environment is focused on all three categories of factors in the 3P model with a distinct emphasis on ensuring that students are using appropriate cognitive skills to attain outcomes.
