###Writing with your reader in mind

>“Professor, I know so much less than you, who will give me my grade. So my role is to show you how much information I am capable of digging up, and after digging up that information, present it in written form;it will be yours to decide whether I’ve found enough.”
Result: A pointless exercise.

###Reader expectations

* Word arrangement is a powerful technique of composition.

* It’s not just what you say, it’s how you say it.

* And it’s not just the words you use, but where you place them.

* Word placement and pauses are powerful techniques of emphasis. \(Gopen& Swan, 1990\)

###Courses

HKIN 375 Research and Measurement

HKIN 370 Biomechanics

* Technical courses; students consider these courses interesting and applicable, but also very challenging

* Involve the application of abstract or mathematical concepts \(e.g. applying biomechanical principles to movement analysis; the process of research\)

* Each course requires a major paper \(30-33% of final grade\)

####HKIN 375 Research Proposal Assignment

Purpose:to develop a research proposal that investigates the influence of some variable on some physical or psychological parameter

####Assignment Objectives

1. For students to engage in the search process for, analyze and synthesize existing research pertaining to a specific topic \(truncated literature review\)

2. For students to construct a research question/hypothesis and propose a study methodology that could answer that question and test hypothesis\(es\).

###HKIN 375 Research Proposal Assignment

1. TopicOutline February1st,2017

* Title of proposal

* Overview paragraph

* Purpose statement and hypothesis

* 10 references \(APA format\)

2. Draft of literature review\(4-5 pages\) March 6th,2017

3. Draft of methods\(6-8 pages\) March 29th, 2017

####Resources

* Database searching session \(Duncan Dixon\)

* Checklists for literature searching \(organizing information\)u

* To help students with critical assessment of journal articles \(methods and statistics\), provision of practical journal articles written to professional audiences

* Article critique assignment \(helps to ‘scaffold’ the proposal assignment by engaging in the practice of reading articles critically\)

* Marking rubric for the proposal assignment given a priori

* Students work in pairs \(encourages collaboration\)

* Students hand in assignment components \(MS Word\), uploaded to MyCourses at specific intervals

* MS Word ‘Track Changes’ and ‘Comment’ functions to provide feedback; allow for follow-up to see if/how students incorporated feedback


###Examples of feedback

####Student paragraph

>“Newton’sfirst law of Inertia states that, ‘an object will remain at rest or continue to move with a constant velocity as long as the force acting on it remains at zero’.

>This is implicated during the volleyball spike when the athlete needs to overcome their body’s inertia by leaving their state of rest and entering a state of vertical motion.”

####Professor feedback:

>“So maybe try to incorporate these laws into a sentence as opposed to definition.

>For example:‘The purpose of the jump phase is to…wherein the player must apply a force of sufficient magnitude to overcome his inertia in order to place his body to a specific place in space \(Newton’s first law\).’

>But do you want to discuss those laws here or is a discussion of changing momentum more apt? What do you think?”

####Student paragraph

>“These were athletes who had been competing in the sport for over 3 years \(mean = 4.7 +/- 1.4\) and who had been free of injury for 1 full year previous to the testing performed. These individuals were training 12-15 hours per week at high intensity, preparing before a taper for competition.”

####Professor feedback

>“This is good – this gives me a sense of what a ‘trained sprinter’ is. So this can be included in your inclusion criteria.”

###Making formative feedback effective

* Address the topic

* Communicate criteria or performance standard against which student progress will be assessed

* Address the response

* Provide specific feedback based on criteria or performance standard

* Discuss particular errors

* Provide examples that are helpful, including finished products

* Provide gentle guidance

* Provide an opportunity for review

###Challenges

* Time consuming -E.g. HKIN 370 – 45-60 min per paper to provide meaningful feedback \(15 hours of feedback if class size is 15 students\)

* How much feedback to give?

* Fight the temptation to re-write in instances where grammar/organization is poor

###Strengths

* Student responses very positive; find progressive feedback very helpful

* Overall increased student engagement with the assignment

* Completed work is on time and of higher quality

* Students transition from being able to ‘report findings’ to ‘critiquing methods leading to the findings’ and ‘enhanced presentation’ of their work

* Shift from ‘professor’ role to ‘mentor’ role

* Helps with preparation for the final exam
