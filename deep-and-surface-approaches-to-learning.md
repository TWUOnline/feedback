### Deep and Surface Approaches

Learning environments are monumentally complex systems influenced by many different factors. Biggs, Kember and Leung \(2001\) created what they call the 3P Model for teaching and learning, reproduced below.

The 3P Model shows the different categories of influences on learning environments and how they interact to produce learning.

The presage influences are those factors which precede the learning environment, including both student factors and the teaching context. Student factors include such things as each student's individual prior knowledge, their cognitive ability and their preferred approaches to learning. Clearly, as the number of students in a particular learning environment increases, the number of influences increases exponentially. The teaching context includes the structure of the environment, how the objectives are designed and assessed, the social climate in the environment, characteristics of the teacher, and various institutional policies and procedures.

Student factors and the teaching context influence each other and they influence both the process and the products of the learning. This mutual influence suggests that students will adjust their preferred approach to learning when they encounter different teaching contexts or learning activities.

The second category of influences is the learning-focused activities in which students engage in order to meet the learning outcomes. Biggs, Kember and Leung refer to these activities as 'ongoing approaches to learning'. They argue that the process level is the 'heart of the teaching/learning system' \(p. 136\). In support of this view, they quote Shuell:

> If students are to learn desired outcomes in a reasonably effective manner, then the teacherâ€™s fundamental task is to get students to engage in learning activities that are likely to result in their achieving those outcomes. It is important to remember that what the student does is more important than what the teacher does. \(Shuell, 1986, p. 429\)

Deep: students use high-level cognitive skills for tasks which require them

Surface: students use low-level cognitive skills for tasks which require high-level cognitive skills
