# Defining Feedback

Hattie and Timperley \(2007\) identified a model for effective feedback that provides the theoretical foundation for how to provide feedback and why feedback is so important for student learning and the attainment of learning outcomes through the use of high-level cognitive skills. They argue that feedback is among the top 10 influences on student achievement, but that the effect can be either positive or negative, leading to the conclusion that it is important to understand how to ensure the effect is positive.

Please take a few minutes to read Hattieâ€™s recent book section [_Feedback in schools_](http://visiblelearningplus.com/sites/default/files/Feedback article.pdf).

## Reflection

In the discussion forum, write something about Hattie's view of feedback and include a connection to your own experience. Keep in mind that this is a discussion forum, so you can feel free to be more conversational than formal in your writing, but please make sure that you attribute ideas and resources that are not your own.
